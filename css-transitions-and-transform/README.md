# CSS Transitions and Transform

## Before we start

1. This practical task is verified automatically with tests.
2. Please put all your `CSS` code in the `src/style.css` file. If you use any other file, we will not be able to verify it.
3. Please, don't change the page structure, it may affect tests.

## Development

While developing, you can open `src/index.html` in your browser to check it. However, we have prepared a more convenient way to run it locally, you can find the details here: [Local Development](https://gitlab.com/gap-bs-front-end-autocode-documents/autocode-documents/-/blob/main/docs/LocalDevelopment.md).

## Check your solution before submitting it (OPTIONAL)

To be sure you submit a correct solution, you can verify it locally. This requires some local setup. Here are the instructions: [Verify your solution locally](https://gitlab.com/gap-bs-front-end-autocode-documents/autocode-documents/-/blob/main/docs/VerifySolutionLocally.md).

## Task Requirements

In this task, you will apply transform and transition properties to different HTML elements on a page. Read carefully to make sure you apply the correct properties to each element and don't add unnecessary ones.

Please note that you MUST add all CSS rules to the `src/style.css` file without changing the `src/index.html` file. Your solution cannot be verified if you use a different file.

On the `index.html` page, you will see ten blocks. On each of these blocks, you should apply CSS transform and/or transition properties as instructed below:

1.	For the first block, apply a skew transformation along the Y-axis at 30 degrees.
2.	For the second block, apply a 2D rotation clockwise with an angle of 45 degrees.
3.	For the third block, apply a 1.5 scale transformation using the the scaleX function.
4.	Make the fourth block 2n in size on hover with a transition of 2 s.
5.	Make the fifth block move 40 px to the right on hover, with a transition of 300 ms.
6.	Make the sixth block rotate counterclockwise in 2D on hover, with an angle of 90 degrees, a background of #ff0000, a transition of 3 s, and an animation delay of 200 ms.
7.	Make the seventh block move 100 px to the right on hover with a transition of 3s and timing that starts slowly, quickly speeds up, and then slows down at the end (Make sure to use the proper transition timing function).
8.	Make the eighth block 2D rotate on hover counterclockwise with an angle of 1090 degrees, a transition of 5 s, and a timing effect that ends slowly (Make sure to use the proper transition timing function).
9.	Make the ninth block rotate counterclockwise on hover in 2D with an angle of 500 degrees and a transition of 2s. The center of rotation should be the top-left corner of the block.
10.	Make the tenth block rotate clockwise on hover in 2D with an angle of 460 degrees, a transition of 5 s, and an animation delay of 300 ms. The center of rotation should be the bottom-right corner of the block.
