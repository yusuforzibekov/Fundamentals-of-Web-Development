2
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
There's Voyager crossing over into interstellar space.

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It is the farthest thing we've ever sent anywhere.

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Voyager accomplished its mission so brilliantly, and now goes on.

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This vehicle, which is long passed its expected service life is still sending messages.

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
To go beyond what we know in our neighborhood.

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We are boldly going where no one has gone before. It's as simple as that.

8
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is awesome.

9
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The Voyager record and really the Voyager mission were conceived and executed on behalf of all humankind.

10
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
with the sounds and heartbeats and whale sounds, and all the different languages of the world.

11
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
'Hello from the children of planet Earth'

12
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
My name is Nick Sagan. I'm the son of Carl Sagan and in the 70's I recorded,

13
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
'Hello from the children of planet Earth,' for the Voyager Golden Record.

14
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Dad would be enormously proud. It would be a great celebration. It's an amazing accomplishment.

15
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
(Portuguese for 'Peace and happiness to all')

16
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I was selected to do Portuguese.

17
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It's hard to imagine aliens being able to decipher the Golden record.

18
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But if they can decipher it, I like to think that they'll take our message in a positive spirit.

19
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So we stand today at the threshold of a great epoch of infinite potential for discovery and exploration.

20
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
This is not science fiction. This is better than science fiction. This is science reality.

21
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So Voyager I bid you farewell.

22
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And thank you for being our ambassador.
Job well done.

23
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You should write. You should maybe drop a postcard.  Let us know how you're doing so we shouldn't worry.

24
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Congratulations to every one on the Voyager team.

25
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But don't stop there. Many more worlds to explore.

26
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And thank you for expanding humankind's universe from Earth to interstellar space.

27
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:50.000
