        <h2>Program Description</h2>

        <p>
            The Voyager program is an American scientific program that employs two robotic interstellar probes, Voyager
            1 and Voyager 2.
        </p>

        <p>
            They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable alignment of Jupiter and Saturn, to fly near
            them while collecting data for transmission back to Earth.
        </p>

        <p>
            After launch the decision was taken to send Voyager 2 near Uranus and Neptune to collect data for
            transmission back to Earth.

        <h2>Voyager Golden Record</h2>

        <p>
            Both spacecraft carry a 12-inch (30 cm) golden phonograph record that contains pictures and sounds of Earth,
            symbolic directions on the cover for playing the record, and data detailing the location of Earth.
        </p>

        <p>
            The record is intended as a combination time capsule and an interstellar message to any civilization, alien
            or far-future human, that may recover either of the Voyagers.
