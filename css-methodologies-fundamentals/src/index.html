          <p class="block__description">Encapsulates a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. While blocks can be nested and interact with each other, semantically they remain equal; there is no precedence or hierarchy. Holistic entities without DOM representation (such as controllers or models) can be blocks as well.</p>
          <p class="block__notes">Block names may consist of Latin letters, digits, and dashes. To form a CSS class, add a short prefix for namespacing: .block</p>

          <h2 class="block__title--green--blue--orange">Element</h2>
          <p class="block__description">Parts of a block and have no standalone meaning. Any element is semantically tied to its block</p>
          <p class="block__notes">Element names may consist of Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores. CSS class is formed as block name plus two underscores plus element name: .block__elem</p>

          <h2 class="block__title--green--blue--orange">Modifier</h2>
          <p class="block__description">Flags on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance, behavior or state</p>
          <p class="block__notes">Modifier names may consist of Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores. CSS class is formed as block’s or element’s name plus two dashes: .block--mod or .block__elem--mod and .block--color-black with .block--color-red. Spaces in complicated modifiers are replaced by dash.</p>
