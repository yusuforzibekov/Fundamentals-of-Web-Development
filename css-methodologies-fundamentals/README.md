# CSS Methodologies Fundamentals

## Before we start

1. This practical task is verified automatically with tests.
2. Please put all your `CSS` code in the `src/style.css` file. If you use any other file, we will not be able to verify it.
3. Please, don't change the page structure, it may affect tests.

## Development

While developing, you can open `src/index.html` in your browser to check it. However, we have prepared a more convenient way to run it locally, you can find the details here: [Local Development](https://gitlab.com/gap-bs-front-end-autocode-documents/autocode-documents/-/blob/main/docs/LocalDevelopment.md).

## Check your solution before submitting it (OPTIONAL)

To be sure you submit a correct solution, you can verify it locally. This requires some local setup. Here are the instructions: [Verify your solution locally](https://gitlab.com/gap-bs-front-end-autocode-documents/autocode-documents/-/blob/main/docs/VerifySolutionLocally.md).

## Task Requirements

In this practical task, you are proposed to change a file's HTML and CSS code according to the BEM methodology. On the `index.html` page, you will see a free block with information about the BEM naming convention. Change the class names of the elements to conform to the standards of the BEM methodology. Change the CSS file to apply the proper styles to the block. Note that the styling of the page should not change.

Please note that CSS rules MUST be written in `src/style.css` and that class names must be changed in the `src/index.html` file. The structure of HTML elements should stay the same. Don't change anything except class names. Your solution can't be verified if you use a different file. Also, the structure of HTML elements should stay the same, and don't change anything except class names. 

On the `index.html` page, you can see three blocks. Change the class names of the blocks based on the BEM naming convention. Edit the CSS file to apply the correct styles to each block. Remember that the styling of the page should remain the same.
